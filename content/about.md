I am an electrical engineer that has worked in fields ranging from analog & mixed signal VLSI design, to systems engineering and embedded system design. After a few years in the semiconductor industry, I left to try my hand at smaller startups where I could have more creative influence in the projects I worked on. I also have a strong passion for P2P systems, with a particular interest in blockchain technologies. This has led me to join [Grid+](https://gridplus.io) to help build secure hardware to transact with the blockchain.

I have created this blog as a place to share my ideas and document some projects I work on. Please don't hesitate to reachout if you have any comments on my work!
