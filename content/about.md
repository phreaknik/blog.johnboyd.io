Hello! My name is John Boyd. I am an electrical engineer by trade and a hacker at heart. I worked as an analog & mixed signal design engineer in the semiconductor industry for a few years, but later my career followed my personal passion for embedded systems. I now work as CTO and lead hardware engineer at <a href="https://www.knocki.com/" target="_blank">Knocki</a>, a fun startup trying new ideas in the IoT space.

I have created this blog as a place to document my journies through technology development and hardware hacking. I am not sure what adventures will make it into this blog, but many of the following subjects will likely make an appearance:

* Embedded Systems (Using C/C++ or Rust)
  * ARM, MSP430, Atmel/AVR, etc...
* Machine Learning
* PCB Design, Schematic Capture, Layout & Fabrication
* Reverse Engineering
* Mathematics
* 3D Printing

Enjoy :)
